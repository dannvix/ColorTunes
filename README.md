ColorTunes
==========

This is a HTML5 version of the iTunes 11 album view, which is able to detect the colors in an album cover and generate color scheme for its track list based on the reduced color space.

Color palettes generation is based on the [MMCQ (median cut color quantization) algorithm](http://www.leptonica.com/papers/mediancut.pdf) from the [Leptonica library](http://www.leptonica.com/).
